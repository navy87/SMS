# Helio Inventory Solutions
 
Helio is an inventory management system built with Springboot. It makes life easier for Inventory Management easier with its ease of use and helps clerks avoid the dreadful spreadsheet into a more user-friendly system with many other functionalities.

## What this App Does
This app is on a very early stage and it does do the basic functionalities already. These are some of these features:
* Uses a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) system
* Organizes items in store based on its category and brand.
* Manages Transaction of items in a FIFO way
* Has a Credit and Settlement system for customers taking things on credit
* Creates Customized Report of Transactions and Credits using JasperReport which can be exported to a PDF
* Has dynamic front-end made using Thymleaf
* Secured using Spring Security
* Has a fully functional REST API

## What’s left then?
This does already do a lot, however there are some more stuff that I want to add plus tweaks that I want to make as well.
* Create a frontend using ReactJS
* Create a mobile App using Kotlin or React Native which can be used to register new items using QR Codes or Barcodes
* New Theme – preferably Material UI
* Internationalization
* And some other things I might think of soon.
